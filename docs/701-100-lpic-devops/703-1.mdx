13.  Click **Discover** in the left-hand menu.

14.  In the *Available Fields* menu, click **add** next to each of the following:

    *   **syslog\_facility**

#### Install Filebeat and use the System Module

*   Install Filebeat:

    `yum install filebeat -y`

*   Run the following:

    `filebeat setup`

    If you see a Kibana error, that's fine — it's because we don't yet have Kibana installed.

*   Open the `filebeat.yml` file:

    `vi /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

*   Edit the file:

    *   In the `Elasticsearch output` section, comment out `#output.elasticsearch` and `# hosts`
    *   In the `Logstash output` section, un-comment `output.logstash` and `hosts`.

    Save and quit the file.

*   Enable the syslog module:

    `filebeat modules enable system`

*   Start the Filebeat service:

    `systemctl start filebeat`

*   Restart Logstash:

    `systemctl restart logstash`

*   Ensure there aren't any errors in Logstash:

    `tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log`

    It should be fine. Hit **Ctrl**+**C** to end the process.


#### Connect to Kibana and Explore the Data

*   From your local machine, SSH with port forwarding to your cloud server's public IP:

    `ssh user_name@public_ip -L 5601:localhost:5601`

*   Navigate to `localhost:5601` in your web browser.

*   Go to the **Dashboard** plugin via the side navigation bar.

*   Search for **system** to filter to your system dashboards.

*   Explore your system log data with the supplied dashboards.
